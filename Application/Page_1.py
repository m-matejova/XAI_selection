Choosing the right Explainable AI (XAI) method is critical for research transparency and trust. Our tool is designed to simplify this complex decision process, providing a structured and data-driven approach.

## Key Features:

### 1. Comprehensive Filtering: 

Easily navigate the vast landscape of XAI methods. Our tool allows you to efficiently filter available techniques based on these aspects:

* **Interpretability Scope:** Choose between **Local** (explaining individual predictions) vs. **Global** (explaining overall model behavior).
* **Model Dependence:** Filter for **Model-Agnostic** (works with any model) or **Model-Specific** techniques.
* **Data Type Support:** Ensure the method handles your data (e.g., tabular, images, text).
* **Output Format:** Select from **Visual**, **Numerical**, **Textual**, and **Rules**.

### 2. Decision Making: 

The tool automatically processes the decision matrix and evaluates it using a set of **10 MCDM techniques** to ensure the quality of the solution. **Borda Count** provides a balanced overall ranking of XAI methods.

### 3. Customizable Criteria and Weights: 

Define your own selection criteria (can be objective or subjective) and assign **objective or subjective weights** to reflect their importance in your project. This ensures the selection process is perfectly tailored to your priorities.

### 4. Best Method Recommendation: 
The application processes your input weights and criteria to produce a clear, ranked list, highlighting the single best-suited method for your particular task context.
**Sensitivity analysis** observe how the resulting order of methods changes when modifying the weights.
