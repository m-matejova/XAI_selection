Choosing the right Explainable AI (XAI) method is critical for research transparency and trust. Our tool is designed to simplify this complex decision process, providing a structured and data-driven approach.

## Key Features:

### 1. Comprehensive Filtering: 

Easily navigate the vast landscape of XAI methods. Our tool allows you to efficiently filter available techniques based on these aspects:

* **Interpretability Scope:** Choose between **Local** (explaining individual predictions) vs. **Global** (explaining overall model behavior).
* **Model Dependence:** Filter for **Model-Agnostic** (works with any model) or **Model-Specific** techniques.
* **Data Type Support:** Ensure the method handles your data (e.g., tabular, images, text).
* **Output Format:** Filter by **Computational Complexity**, required **Fidelity**, and more.

### 2. Decision Making: 

At the core of our tool is the **TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)** method. TOPSIS is a renowned **Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)** technique that ranks XAI alternatives by measuring their distance from an ideal best solution and the farthest distance from a negative ideal solution.

### 3. Customizable Criteria and Weights: 

Define your own selection criteria (can be objective or subjective) and assign **objective or subjective weights** to reflect their importance in your project. This ensures the selection process is perfectly tailored to your priorities.

### 4. Best Method Recommendation: 
The application processes your input weights and criteria to produce a clear, ranked list, highlighting the single best-suited method for your particular task context.
